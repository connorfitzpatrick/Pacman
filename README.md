For my final project in my Game Design 2 class, I recreated PacMan using Java. 

The game starts with a main menu granting the option to start or to quit the game.
Upon losing, this screen will reappear.

My version of the game includes everything that was featured in the original.
For example, the game holds power pellets that grant the player the ability to "eat" 
ghosts, the opportunity to teleport to the other side of the screen, sound effects,
savable highscores, and more!

Additionally, the maps appear in a random order and are of a random color, giving each
playthrough its own unique feel! Levels grow in difficulty as the game progresses by
having the ghosts move faster and the power pellets last for a shorter duration.
